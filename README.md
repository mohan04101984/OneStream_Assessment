ðŸš€ .NET Core WebAPI Example with Asynchronous Backend Calls
This project demonstrates how to create a front-end WebAPI that invokes two back-end WebAPIs (API2 and API3) asynchronously using HttpClient.

The back-end APIs simulate artificial delays to mimic long-running operations.
The front-end API supports both GET and POST methods.
For Authentication, We can implement JWT and API Key.
